Flother is the personal web site for Matt Riggott.  It's been through
many interations: PHP (a long time ago; don't judge me), Django, App Engine,
Rails, and now back to Django.  In fact it's now run on Python 2.5 and
Django 1.0, and this is the code.

For the moment it's an incredibly minimal and entirely uninteresting
codebase. But over time it will turn into something more interesting.
I promise.

Requirements:

    * Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)
    * Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/)
    * South (http://south.aeracode.org/)

Django and South (used for database migrations) are included in the
repository within the vendor directory as Git submodules.

You can see the code in action at http://www.flother.com/.  For more
