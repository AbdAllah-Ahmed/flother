Flother is the personal web site for Matt Riggott.  It's been through
many iterations: PHP (a long time ago; don't judge me), Django, App Engine,
Rails, and now back to Django.  In fact it's now run on Python 2.5 and
Django 1.0, and this is the code.

For the moment it's an incredibly minimal and entirely uninteresting
codebase. But over time it will turn into something more interesting.
I promise.

Requirements:

    * Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)
    * Django (http://www.djangoproject.com/)
    * South (http://south.aeracode.org/)
    * Django Compress (http://code.google.com/p/django-compress/)
    * Markdown (http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)

Django, South (used for database migrations), and Django Compress (used to
compress CSS and Javascript into many files from many) are included in the
repository within the vendor directory as Git submodules.  You'll need to include Markdown on your Python path.

Additionally, the Django Debug Toolbar is included as a Git submodule, but
isn't included in INSTALLED_APPS by default.

    * Django Debug Toolbar (http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar)
