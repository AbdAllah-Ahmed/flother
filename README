Introduction
==============

Flother is the personal web site for Matt Riggott.  It's been through many
iterations but now it runs on Python 2.5 and Django 1.1 and is in active
development.  This is the complete source code, released under the GPL v3.0.

It includes four apps that offer a blog, a contact form, file uploads,
and Google-powered search.  (See "Features" below for more information.)  It's
fairly specific to my needs but you may find it useful either as a base for your
own site or to help you learn Django.

You can see the code in action at http://www.flother.com/.  For more
information, contact me: http://www.flother.com/contact/.


Features
==========

There are four main apps within the project. The largest is a blog with
Akismet-moderated comments.  Entries are formatted using Markdown and can be
public, private, or draft.  Draft entries can be previewed on the site by admin
users.  Comments can be enabled entry by entry (i.e. one entry can have comments
while another doesn't) and use Gravatar for author photos.

Next comes a contact form that emails site admins each time a message is sent.
Akismet is used to check whether or not messages are spam â€” if they are, no
email is sent.  Messages are stored in the database.

Third, file uploads.  Files of any type can be uploaded and stored via the
admin.  Thumbnails of images are created and displayed in the admin.  A
Javascript-based interface for using files in blog entries is provided.

And finally, site search.  Google's AJAX API is used (server-side) to perform a
site-wide search and return results on the site itself.


Requirements
==============

    * Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)
    * Django 1.1 (http://www.djangoproject.com/)
    * South (http://south.aeracode.org/)
    * Django Compress (http://code.google.com/p/django-compress/)
    * Markdown (http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)
    * Smartypants (http://web.chad.org/projects/smartypants.py/)

Django, South (used for database migrations), and Django Compress (used to
reduce CSS and Javascript from many files to one) are included in the
repository within the vendor directory as Git submodules.  You'll need to
include Markdown and Smartypants on your Python path.

Additionally, the Django Debug Toolbar is included as a Git submodule but
isn't included in INSTALLED_APPS by default.
