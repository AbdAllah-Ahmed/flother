Flother is the personal web site for Matt Riggott.  It's been through
many interations â€” PHP, Django, App Engine, Rails, and now back to
Django.  In fact it's now run on Python 2.5 and Django 1.0, and this is
the code.

For the moment it's an incredibly minimal and entirely uninteresting
codebase. But over time it will turn into something more interesting.
I promise.

Requirements:

    * Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)

All other requirements (such as Django itself) are included in the
repository, as Git submodules or otherwise.

You can see the code in action at http://www.flother.com/.  For more
information contact me: http://www.flother.com/contact/.
