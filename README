Flother is the personal web site for Matt Riggott.  It's been through
many iterations: but now it runs on Python 2.5 and Django 1.1.  This is the
complete source code, released under the GPL v3.0.

For the moment it includes a blog including Akismet-moderated comments,
Google-powered search, and a contact app.  It's fairly specific to my needs but
you may find it useful either as a base for your own site or to help you learn
Django.

Requirements:

    * Python 2.5 (http://www.python.org/)
    * Django 1.1 (http://www.djangoproject.com/)
    * South (http://south.aeracode.org/)
    * Django Compress (http://code.google.com/p/django-compress/)
    * Markdown (http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)
    * Smartypants (http://web.chad.org/projects/smartypants.py/)

Django, South (used for database migrations), and Django Compress (used to
compress CSS and Javascript into many files from many) are included in the
repository within the vendor directory as Git submodules.  You'll need to
include Markdown and Smartypants on your Python path.

Additionally, the Django Debug Toolbar is included as a Git submodule, but
isn't included in INSTALLED_APPS by default.

    * Django Debug Toolbar (http://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar)
